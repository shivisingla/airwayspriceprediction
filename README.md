# Flight Fare Prediction Web App
Flight Fare Prediction Application is a Web application based on Machine learning. This web application predicts flight fares for various airlines in India for given journey details like Source, destination, date of journey, departure and arrival time. This ML model is deployed in Heroku using Flask.
# Overview:
PThis is a FLask web app the predicts the price of the different airways for various destination from different departure Cities.
# Novelty:
1. Engineering features were applied to remove outliers, drop unwanted data, handle categoricl features, missing values, , explore the correltion b/w numerical features, relating b/w labels and features. Mean squared error of the algorithm was reduced w/o increasing model's complexity.
2. Techniques like grid search and hyperparameter tuning were used to select best model to a build a model suitable for website.
